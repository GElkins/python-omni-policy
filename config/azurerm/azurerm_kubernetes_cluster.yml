            notes: Azure requires that a new, non-existent Resource Group is used,
                as otherwise the provisioning of the Kubernetes Service will fail.
        role_based_access_control:

            policy: ''
            notes: AKS will add a delegation to the subnet named here. To prevent
                further runs from failing you should make sure that the subnet you
                create for virtual nodes has a delegation, like so.
