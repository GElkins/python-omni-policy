        monitor_id:
            description: Reference to which monitor this downtime is applied. When
                scheduling downtime for a given monitor, datadog changes `silenced`
                property of the monitor to match the `end` POSIX timestamp. **Note:**
                this will effectively change the `silenced` attribute of the referenced
                monitor. If that monitor is also tracked by Terraform and you don't
                want it to be unmuted on the next `terraform apply`, see [details](/docs/providers/datadog/r/monitor.html#silencing-by-hand-and-by-downtimes
