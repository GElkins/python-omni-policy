        log_group_name:
            description: Name of the cloudwatch log group to which the logs should
                be published. The log group should be already created and the directory
                service principal should be provided with required permission to create
                stream and publish logs. Changing this value would delete the current
                subscription and create a new one. A directory can only have one log
                subscription at a time.
