        role_name:
            description: The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically
                preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the master
                account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role,
                as permitted by the master account administrator. The role has administrator
                permissions in the new member account. The Organizations API provides
                no method for reading this information after account creation, so
                Terraform cannot perform drift detection on its value and will always
                show a difference for a configured value after import unless [`ignore_changes`](/docs/configuration/resources.html#ignore_changes
