        to get events from Kinesis, DynamoDB and SQS
    arguments:
        batch_size:
            description: The largest number of records that Lambda will retrieve from
                your event source at the time of invocation. Defaults to `100` for
                DynamoDB and Kinesis, `10` for SQS.

        maximum_batching_window_in_seconds:
            description: The maximum amount of time to gather records before invoking
                the function, in seconds.  Records will continue to buffer until either
                `maximum_batching_window_in_seconds` expires or `batch_size` has been
                met. Defaults to as soon as records are available in the stream. If
                the batch it reads from the stream only has one record in it, Lambda
                only sends one record to the function.
