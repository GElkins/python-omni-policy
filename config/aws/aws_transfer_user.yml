            description: An IAM JSON policy document that scopes down user access
                to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. IAM variables you can use inside
                this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`,
                and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`. Since the IAM variable syntax matches
                Terraform's interpolation syntax, they must be escaped inside Terraform
                configuration strings (`$${Transfer:UserName}`).  These are evaluated
                on-the-fly when navigating the bucket.
