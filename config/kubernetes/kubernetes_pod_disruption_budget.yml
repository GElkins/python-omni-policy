    description: A Pod Disruption Budget limits the number of pods of a replicated
        application that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. For example,
        a quorum-based application would like to ensure that the number of replicas
        running is never brought below the number needed for a quorum. A web front
        end might want to ensure that the number of replicas serving load never falls
        below a certain percentage of the total.
