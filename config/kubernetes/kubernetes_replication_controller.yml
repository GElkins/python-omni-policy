        \ \u201Creplicas\u201D are running at any one time. In other words, a Replication\
        \ Controller makes sure that a pod or homogeneous set of pods are always up\
        \ and available. If there are too many pods, it will kill some. If there are\
        \ too few, the Replication Controller will start more."
