# python-omni-policy
Declarative data store, API, and documentation for the sentinel-omni-policy for Hashicorp Terraform.  This repo includes the following components:

- **The omni-policy cli tool** (executable) - for fetching, creating, merging, extending and bulk updating all data pertaining to Hashicorp Terraform providers and resources.
- **/config** (directory) - contains folders and associated resources in YAML format for all Terrafrom providers with a status of "enabled" in providers.yaml
- **config/providers.yaml** (configuration) - YAML file containing a merged map of all Terraform providers, descriptions, url and status.  New providers merged by the cli tool will get a default value of "disabled".  If using the sentinel-omni-policy and you want to permit use of a provider by Terraform, change the status of that provider to "enabled".
- **config/custom.yaml** (configuration) - YAML file containing a merged map of custom variables that are used in naming conventions and tags.  Each variable contains a map of allowed_values that are the permissible values for this field in the policy.
- **/data** (directory) - contains folders and associated resources in JSON format for easier consumption through github API and sentinel.  All data in this directory will update when the omni-policy cli tool is envoked.

## What is the purpose
This repository contains a complete data snapshot of all Hashicorp Terraform providers, resources and resource attributes.  This data has been extended by key/value pairs that allow for policy to be declared in an easy YAML format.  The sentinel-omni-policy repository contains the sentinel policy that reads this data and applies the policy in real time to Terraform Enterprise.  This allows non-developer security personnel to manage the policy in a more comprehensive and natural way.

## Example Usage
Configuration YAML files are provided for all Terraform 'providers' that have been enabled in the providers.yaml file.  Within the config directory the resource type is in a config/$provider/$resource_name.yaml format.  Those yaml files look like the following.

```
aws_iot_thing:
    status: ASSESS
    subcategory: IoT
    layout: aws
    page_title: 'AWS: aws_iot_thing'
    description: Creates and manages an AWS IoT Thing.
    arguments:
        name:
            description: The name of the thing.
            required: true
            policy: '<market>-<businessUnit>-[0-9][0-9]'
            notes: 'Any special notes you want to return if the policy check fails'
        attributes:
            description: Map of attributes of the thing.
            required: false
            policy: ''
            notes: ''
        thing_type_name:
            description: The thing type name.
            required: false
            policy: ['this','that']
            notes: ''
    attributes:
        default_client_id:
            description: The default client ID.
        version:
            description: The current version of the thing record in the registry.
        arn:
            description: The ARN of the thing.
    timeouts: {}
```

## How it works
 This sentinel policy can be used against any provider, resource and argument that Terraform supports.  For each resource being modified in Terraform it does a lookup of the omni-policy map for that resource located at [python-omni-policy](https://github.com/openrba/python-omni-policy) and applies a set of rules based on certain keys provided by that map.  The following keys are used by this policy:

 - **status** (resource) - Status is a key-value pair at the resource level that indicates the current ring level of the resource.  Ring levels are a continuation of the excellent work of the thoughworks techradar that organizes technologies into five distinct classifications e.g REJECT,HOLD,ASSESS,TRIAL,ADOPT. Using the input parameter min_ring, the sentinel policy applies a mandatory access control method to permit anything at that ring level or higher.  For example a min_ring value of "ASSESS" would permit any resource at a ring level of ASSESS,TRIAL, and ADOPT.

- **required** (argument) - Required is a key-value pair at the argument level of a resource that indicates whether the argument is required or not.  This policy uses this key from the [python-omni-policy](https://github.com/openrba/python-omni-policy) map for the resource to assure the argument is present in any resource being created through Terraform.

- **policy** (argument) - Policy is a key-value pair at the argument level that indicates the policy to be applied to the argument's value when passed through the policy. It requires the "required" argument above to be set to "true". It includes the following capabilities:
    - **string-match** - Exact match of an argument's value against a specific string and is the simpliest form of enforcing a specific value.  Example: `standard` matches only "standard".
    - **bool-match** - Will match boolean values against boolean arguments in the terrafrom resource.  Example: policy: true would match the azurerm_virtual_machine resource argument delete_data_disks_on_termination set to boolean true.
    - **list-match** - Exact match of an argument's value against *any* of a list of strings.  Example: `['standard','basic']` would match either "standard" or "basic".
    - **regex-match** - A regex match of an argument's value against a specific regex expression.  This value must start with a `^` or a string-match will occur.  Example: `^[a-z].` would validate that the argument must contain any number of lowercase alpha characters.
    - **convention-match** - A match that expects a naming convention that includes lookup fields.  Fields will be looked up against the custom.json map in [python-omni-policy](https://github.com/openrba/python-omni-policy) that contains allowed_values for a particular field.  Example: the value of `<market>-<businessUnit>-[0-9][0-9]` will match to `us-core-01` assuming `us` is an allowed_value for market and `core` is allowed_value for businessUnit in your custom.json.

-> **NOTE:** Any modification to an existing YAML file currently requires a run of the omni-policy cli tool to update, merge and generate the json data in the API.  It is expected that this process get put in a simple CI engine such as GitHub actions to perform this automatically on merge.  Until then, you may run this tool manually on your clone after updating any YAML configuration.
